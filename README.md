Hey Whatś up! I'm glad you are here

So, last week I was on the OneWeekCode, where I made a very impressive site using JS and
I realize that the content there were so difficult to me to learn because I haven't touched VScode
in months then someday I decided to make a "Full-Stack site" haha

So I got to learn the "Essencials" again in this 5 day coding a simple Site Project, just to come
down for a few days, who have been in a OneWeekCode for the first time know what Iḿ talking about haha

So you can see the project rigth there, I hope you like it!
